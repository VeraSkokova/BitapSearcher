# BitapSearcher
Implementation of Bitap algorithm (TOOI task)

The bitap algorithm (also known as the shift-or, shift-and or Baeza-Yatesâ€“Gonnet algorithm) is
an approximate string matching algorithm. The algorithm tells whether a given text contains
a substring which is "approximately equal" to a given pattern.
